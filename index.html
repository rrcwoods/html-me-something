                <p>Hi, my name is Ryan Doherty. I am an Events Manager, based in Austin, TX & Kansas City, MO who originally got into the Industry unabashedly thinking I would be able to get free tickets to every show in town. I was incorrect — but am still enjoying the ride. To date, I have learned from and worked with top-flight groups and events including:</p>
                <ul class="clientList">
                    <li>The PGA Tour</li>
                    <li>The Kansas City Chiefs</li>
                    <li>South By Southwest (SXSW)</li>
                    <li>Austin City Limits Music Festival</li>
                    <li>AEG Presents (Midwest)</li>
                    <li>The Web.com Tour</li>
                    <li>Dancefestopia Music Festival</li>
                    <li>& many others...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To any team I work with — I bring a distinct sense of humor, a deep uncertainty whether personal bios should be written in the first or third-person, and three-plus years experience in fields such as Talent Buying & Contracting, Event Logistics & Operations, Marketing & Analytics, Content Creation, Concert & Festival Production, Accounts Receivable / Accounts Payable (AR/AP), and Ticketing Platform Management.</p>
                <p>My next journey is learning how to code, in order better pursue my personal endeavors, as well as offer an extended skillset to my clients</p>
